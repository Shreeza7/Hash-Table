Designed a hash table with a custom hash function designed for efficient storage and retrieval of character data. Experimented with different table sizes to observe the impact on collision occurrences, concurrently tracking the number of collisions for each table.

Analyzed hash collisions by inserting identical data into hash tables of varying sizes for comparative evaluation.
